# Resume 

I have been writing software since 2005 and have always tried to stay ahead of the pack by keeping up with the latest in technology. Apart from a passion for technology, I am passionate about imparting whatever it is that I learn. I have authored [several books on programming](http://amzn.to/2xhfd4y) and have written numerous blog posts and contributed to various guest articles on other sites such as BitRebels. 

I started my career at a small privately owned company, developing ASP.NET Web Applications using VB.NET and C#. Later I moved to a national company where I did SYSPRO integration and customization using C# as my main language. 

After 8 years doing SYSPRO integration, I decided that it was time to move on. I am currently employed by a company in the UK where I can live out my creativity developing exciting integrations and applications.
