I have been writing software for more than 13 years and have always tried to stay ahead of the pack by keeping up with the latest in technology. Apart from a passion for technology, I am passionate about imparting whatever it is that I learn. I have authored [two books on C#](http://www.amazon.com/author/dirkstrauss) and have written numerous blog posts and contributed to various guest articles on other sites such as BitRebels. 

I started my career at a small privately owned company, developing ASP.NET Web Applications using VB.NET and C#. Later I moved to a national company where I did SYSPRO integration and customization using C# as my main language. 

After 8 years doing SYSPRO integration, I decided that it was time to move on. I am currently employed by a company in Cape Town, South Africa where I can live out my creativity developing responsive web applications.

## C# Code Contracts Succinctly
Developed by Microsoftâ€™s Research in Software Engineering, Code Contracts provide a way to convey code assumptions in your .NET applications. They can take the form of preconditions, postconditions, and state invariants. In C# Code Contracts Succinctly, author Dirk Strauss demonstrates how to use Code Contracts to validate logical correctness in code, how they can be integrated with abstract classes and interfaces, and even how they can be used to make writing documentation less painful.
